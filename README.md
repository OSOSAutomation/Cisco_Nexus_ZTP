# Cisco_Nexus_ZTP
Automate Cisco Nexus Provisioning
The code will implement Nexus upgrade, initial configuration & VPC domain configuration without touching the switches command line interface using Python application interactive interface.
Please refer to Cisco press books + Python certified books for a solid understanding about the theories behind this solution.
Python is one of the major new programmability coding languages nowadays used in large next generation networking solutions based on implementation automation.
There is no much time like earlier days to configure devices manually especially with the standardized configuration required over multiple networking devices.
Automation is required in everyday task to facilitate faster working with day-to-day activities.
The first thing to understand automation is to define the best programming language that will be used for automation.
Adding to Python scripts, the use of YANG (Yet Another Next Generation) along with NETCONF (NETwork CONFiguration) & RESTAPI (RESTful Application Programming Interface) as certified by IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) provides the required tool for this modeling and device interaction.
In our lab here, we will be using Python to define all the required programmability & automation tasks as a DMD (Data-Model Driven) as well as a coding software to the appliances.
It also requires some hands-on experience with the mentioned technologies to support the implementation of this datacenter programmability setup.
This code is going according to the following procedure:
 Why Python.
 Solution Flowchart.
 Application Structure.
 Phase-1: Meet The Application.
 Phase-2: Checking For Upgrades.
 Phase-3: POAP.
 Phase-4: Device Initialization.
 Phase-5: VPC Configuration.
 Phase-6: Complementary Configuration.
 Phase-7: Finalizations & Confirmations.
